### Description
You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?

## Your Task

Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.

## Rules

* you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once
* it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg
* we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)
* for simplicity we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it

## Example

```javascript
cookingTime(0); // must return 0
cookingTime(5); // must return 5
cookingTime(10); // must return 10
```

```coffeescript
cookingTime 0 # must return 0
cookingTime 5 # must return 5
cookingTime 10 # must return 10
```

```ruby
cooking_time 0 # must return 0
cooking_time 5 # must return 5
cooking_time 10 # must return 10
```

```haskell
cookingTime  0 `shouldBe` 0
cookingTime  5 `shouldBe` 5
cookingTime 10 `shouldBe` 10
```
