Category : bug_fixes

### Description
Something is wrong with our Warrior class. The strike method does not work correctly. The following shows an example of this code being used:

```javascript
var ninja = new Warrior('Ninja');
var samurai = new Warrior('Samurai');

samurai.strike(ninja, 3);
// ninja.health should == 70
```

```coffeescript
ninja = new Warrior('Ninja')
samurai = new Warrior('Samurai')

samurai.strike(ninja, 3)
# ninja.health should == 70
```

Can you figure out what is wrong?
