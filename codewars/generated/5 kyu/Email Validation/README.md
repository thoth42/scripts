### Description
Email addresses are notoriously difficult to validate.

Create a method that takes an email and returns true if valid, false otherwise.

Tip: It doesn't have to be perfect.

For example:
```ruby
validate('joe@example.com') => true
validate('joe') => false 
```

I suggest not using some code that you find on the internet. Yes, there are regexes that do email validation. But what is the purpose of copying and pasting?

Also, you do not need to use a regex. There are many ways of solving this.
