### Description
Sometimes you need to know all classes that inherited from you, and to be able to do simple things like listing or calling all of them.

Write a class called "Mother" that tracks all inheritances that are done to her (and her kids), together with a class method "phone_kids" that calls in turn the class method "phone" of all kids.

So if you have two kids

```
class Foo
