### Description
Snail Sort
Given an array of n x n, return the array elements arranged from outer most elements to the middle element.

```ruby
array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

For better understanding, please follow the numbers of the next array consecutively:
```ruby
array = [[1,2,3],
         [8,9,4],
         [7,6,5]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

This image will illustrate things more clearly:

NOTE: The idea is not sort the elements from the lowest value to the highest, the idea is sort them in a snail way
