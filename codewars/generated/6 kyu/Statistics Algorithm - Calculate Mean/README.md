Category : algorithms

### Description
Create a mathematical algorithm to calculate the mean of a series of numbers.  The mean of a series of numbers is the sum of all items in a set, divided by the number of items in that set.

Examples: 


calc_mean([]) should return 0 


calc_mean([1, 2, 3]) should return 2.0 


calc_mean([6, 8, 10]) should return 8.0 


calc_mean([15, 30, 60, 120, 240]) should return 93.0

Inputs are always populated (non-empty) arrays.  Input arrays never include non-integer or non-float elements.  Non-array inputs return 0.
