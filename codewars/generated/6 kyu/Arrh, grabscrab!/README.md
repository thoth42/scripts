### Description
Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.

At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.

Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.

For example:

    grabscrab "ortsp", ["sport", "parrot", "ports", "matey"]

Should return `["sport", "ports"]`.

Good luck!


The kata tests are the same as the sample fixtures.

Return an empty array if there are no matches.

For best results, return matches in the same order as in the dictionary.
