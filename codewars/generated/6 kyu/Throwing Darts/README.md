### Description
You've just recently been hired to calculate scores for a  Dart Board game! 



Scoring specifications:


0 points - radius above 10


5 points - radius between 5 and 10 inclusive


10 points - radius less than 5



If all radiuses are less than 5, award 100 BONUS POINTS!



Write a function that accepts an array of radiuses (can be integers and/or floats), 

 and returns a total score using the above specification.


 An empty array should return 0.



Examples:


scoreThrows( [1, 5, 11] ) => returns 15 


scoreThrows( [15, 20, 30] ) => returns 0 


scoreThrows( [1, 2, 3, 4] ) => returns 140
