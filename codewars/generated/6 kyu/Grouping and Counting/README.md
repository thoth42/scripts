Category : reference

### Description
Your goal is to write the group_and_count method, which should receive and array as unique parameter and return a hash. Empty or nil input must return nil instead of a hash.
This hash returned must contain as keys the unique values of the array, and as values the counting of each value.

Example usage:
```ruby
input = [1,1,2,2,2,3]

group_and_count(input)# == {1=>2, 2=>3, 3=>1}
```

The following methods were disabled:
```
Array#count
Array#length
```
