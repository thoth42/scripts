## Reverse linked list

Category : algorithms

### Description
Let's say we have a singly linked list.
Emtpy list is represented by `null`.
Non-empty list is represented by 2-element array `[value, tail]`.

So for example list with values 1, 2, 3 would be represented as `[1, [2, [3, null]]]`.

Your job is to develop function `reverseList` which returns elements of given list in reverse order without modification of the original list.

P.S. Make sure your solution works on huge lists.
