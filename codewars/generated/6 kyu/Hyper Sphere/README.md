### Description
To pass this kata you are required to complete the function in_sphere?.  You will be given an array of cordinates and a radius. The function should return true if the coordinates describe a point within the given radius of the origin ([0,0...0]). A point with no co-ordinates should return true. (In zero dimensions all points are the same point)

In two dimensions the condition that any [x,y] co-ordinate lies in a circle is:-

***
x
2 + y
2 2
***

This generalises to higer dimensions as follows.

***
x
12 + x
22 + ... x
n2 2
***
