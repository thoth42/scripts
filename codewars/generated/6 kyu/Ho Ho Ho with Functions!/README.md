### Description
Santa is learning programming. And what could be the first program, he wants to write? Yes, the "Hello world!" of Christmas: "Ho Ho Ho!". He wants to write a function `ho()`, which should have the following return values:

```javascript
ho(); // should return "Ho!"
ho(ho()); // should return "Ho Ho!"
ho(ho(ho())); // should return "Ho Ho Ho!"
```

Unfortunately he couldn't find any tutorial, which explains, how he could implement that. Can you help him?

Rules:

* each call of `ho()` must add a "Ho" to the string
* the "Ho"'s must be separated by a space
* at the end of the string, there must be an exclamation mark (`!`), without a space
