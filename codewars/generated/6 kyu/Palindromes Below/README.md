Category : algorithms

### Description
The aim of this Kata is to modify the `Fixnum` ( **JS**: `Number` ) class to give it the `palindrome_below` ( **JS**: `palindromeBelow` ) method. This method returns all numbers from and including 1 up to but not including itself that are palindromes for a given **[base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix)**.

For example in base 2 (binary)

    1 = "1"
    2 = "10"
    3 = "11"
    4 = "100"

Therefore 1 and 3 are palindromes in base two and the method should return the following.

    5.palindrome_below(2)
    => [1, 3]
