## Plural

### Description
We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not. This would be useful when printing out a string such as `5 minutes`, `14 apples`, or `1 sun`. You only need to worry about english grammar rules for this kata.

All values will be positive integers or floats. You cannot have less than zero of a thing, and so plurality wouldn't make sense.
