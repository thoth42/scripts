### Description
You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop.

Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.  

For example in the following picture the tail's size is 3 and the loop size is 11.![Image and video hosting by TinyPic](http://i42.tinypic.com/27wrmed.png)

node.next
```
